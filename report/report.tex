\section{Introduction}

This project consists in the development and comparison of two methods to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem in a specific domain, namely the drilling of holes in electric panel boards.
In particular, the problem consists in minimizing the time the drill needs to prepare each board.
Since the time it takes to drill a single hole is assumed to be constant, the problem is equivalent to minimizing the time needed to move the drill through each hole position.

The first method is based on a mixed integer linear programming formulation of the problem and always yield an optimal solution.
The second approach, instead, uses an heuristic method which may result in suboptimal solutions.
On the other hand, it should require less computational resources, such as time, threads and memory.

The first method uses the CPLEX library, whereas the second one leverages tabu search.
Both of them are implemented using C++.

\paragraph{Notation}
In the rest of the report we will be using the following symbol with the meaning described below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$N$:] the nodes in the graph representation of the problem, i.e. the set of holes on the board.
    \item[$A$:] the arcs in the graph representation of the problem, i.e. the possible moves between two holes.
    \item[$c_{i j}$:] the cost of traveling over an arc, i.e. the time the drill takes to move from hole $i$ to hole $j$.
    \item[$0$:] an arbitrary node from which the traveler starts, i.e. the first hole to be drilled.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Domain Characteristics and Assumptions}
The domain of the problem being restricted to the movement of a drill on electric panel boards allows to assume some realistic characteristics of the problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item holes are aligned in a grid, likely in rectangular shapes;
    \item the number of holes on each board is between 10 and 250.
\end{itemize}
A further assumption is that the drill can move at constant speed in any direction.
We therefore assume that the time needed to move the drill from a hole to the next one is proportional to the linear distance between the two.

\section{Exact Method}

\subsection{MILP Formulation}
The exact method uses the following mathematical formulation of the problem.
\begin{align}
    \min & \sum_{i,j : (i,j) \in A} c_{i j} y_{i j}                                                                                                 \\
    \label{MILP:consume}
    s.t. & \sum_{i : (i,k) \in A} x_{i k} - \sum_{j : (k,j) \in A, j \neq 0} x_{k j} &  & = 1                    &  & \forall k \in N               \\
    \label{MILP:output}
         & \sum_{j : (i,j) \in A} y_{i j}                                            &  & = 1                    &  & \forall i \in N               \\
    \label{MILP:input}
         & \sum_{i : (i,j) \in A} y_{i j}                                            &  & = 1                    &  & \forall j \in N               \\
    \label{MILP:activation}
         & x_{i j}                                                                   &  & \leq (|N| - 1) y_{i j} &  & \forall (i,j) \in A, j \neq 0 \\
         & x_{i j} \in \mathbb{R}                                                    &  &                        &  & \forall (i,j) \in A, j \neq 0 \\
         & y_{i j} \in \{0, 1\}                                                      &  &                        &  & \forall (i,j) \in A
\end{align}

The idea behind this formulation consider the TSP as a network flow problem.

There are two sets of variables.
The real $x_{i j}$ variables indicate the amount of flow from node $i$ to node $j$, while the binary $y_{i j}$ variables indicate whether there is any flow between the noe $i$ and $j$.

The formulation assumes there is a flow of amount $(|N|-1)$ coming out of the starting node $0$.
Then it constraints each node to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item consume one unit of flow (\ref{MILP:consume});
    \item forward the flow only to one node (\ref{MILP:output});
    \item receive the flow only to one node (\ref{MILP:input}).
\end{itemize}

Finally, the constraint (\ref{MILP:activation}) ensures that if there is flow from node $i$ to node $j$, then $y_{i j} = 1$.
Th fact that if there is no flow from node $i$ to node $j$, then $y_{i j} = 0$ is ensured by optimality.

This formulation corresponds to the one presented in \cite{gavish1978travelling}.

\section{Heuristic Method}

\subsection{Algorithm Design}
The chosen algorithm uses the tabu search meta-heuristic.
Each component of the algorithm will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph{Initial Solution}
To generate the initial solution the farthest node insertion heuristic has been used.
This heuristic has been implemented in its deterministic flavour using the two farthest nodes as a starting loop.

\paragraph{2.5-opt Moves}
This type of move, described in \cite{johnson1997traveling}, is used to generate the neighborhood and consists in either a 2-opt move or a reposition move.
A 2-opt move consists in inverting a sub-tour, while a reposition move consists in moving a single node to a different position in the tour.
At each iteration there are $O(n^2)$ possible 2.5-opt moves.

\paragraph{Move Evaluation}
This type of move allows for incremental evaluation in constant time.
In particular, for a 2-opt move that invert the sub-tour $i$-$j$, we have
$$ \Delta C_{\textrm{2-opt}} = c_{p(i), j} + c_{i, s(j)} - c_{p(i), i} - c_{j, s(j)} $$
Instead, for a reposition move that shifts the node $i$ just after the node $j$, assuming that $j \neq i$ and $j$ is not immediately preceding $i$, we have
$$ \Delta C_{\textrm{rep}} = c_{p(i), s(i)} - c_{p(i), i} - c_{i, s(i)} - c_{j, s(j)} + c_{j, i} + c_{i, s(j)} $$

Where $p(i)$ is the node preceding $i$ in the current tour and $s(i)$ is the node following $i$ in the current tour.

\paragraph{Solution Representation}
The solution is represented as a sequence of nodes in order to easily apply 2.5-opt moves.
In the sequence each node appears exactly once.

In the solution, the traveler starts the tour from the first node and visits each node in the order they appear in the vector.
After visiting the last node, the traveler goes back to the first one.

\paragraph{Tabu List}
The tabu list used in the algorithm is fixed-size and keeps in memory the last 2.5-opt moves performed.
While choosing the next 2.5-opt move to perform, the algorithm excludes the ones in the list.

In some cases, though, the tabu list can be by-passed.
This happens when a move which is tabu leads to a solution which is the best found so far.

\paragraph{Exploring Strategy}
The algorithms performs a tabu search using the steepest descent criteria on the 2.5-opt neighborhood.
If no improving moves can be found, then the algorithm picks the worst one.
In this way, the algorithm can escape the local minima by exploiting diversification of the explored solutions.

\paragraph{Stopping Criteria}
The algorithms halts when one of the following conditions is met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the maximum number of non increasing iterations is reached;
    \item the maximum number of iterations is reached.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Configuration of the Algorithm}
The following parameters of the algorithm that can be configured:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Size of tabu list}
          This is the maximum number of moves stored in the tabu list.
          If this number is too high:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item it takes up more memory;
              \item it may exclude too many moves, including the ones that may lead to an improvement.
          \end{itemize}
          On the other hand, if it is too low, the risk of moving around a local minimum without escaping from it increases.

    \item \textbf{Maximum number of iterations}
          This is the maximum number of moves that the algorithm can perform.
          If it is too low, the algorithm may stop before reaching any good solution.
          If it is too high, the algorithm may run for a long time while yielding small or no improvement at all.
          The risk of a high maximum number of iterations may be mitigated by reducing the maximum number of non-improving iterations.

    \item \textbf{Maximum number of non-improving iterations}
          This parameter determines how many non-improving moves, both 2-opt and 2.5-opt, can be performed.
          If it is too high, the risk of moving around the same local minimum without finding a better solution for a long time is high.
          On the other hand, if it is too low, the algorithm could miss the opportunity to escape from a local minimum.

    \item \textbf{Maximum value for non-improving iterations}
          This parameter determines whether a non-improving 2-opt move should be considered.
          It is expressed as

\end{itemize}
